Windsor University - Hey this first semester has turned out
A-OK. I've run into some old friends and stuff so thats cool.
Also made some new ones so thats good too.

Computer Science Program - I like all the coomputer science bits and
absolutely despise the math classes. Linear Algebra and Calc suck. In
fact, I dislike them so much I switched from BCS[H] Computer Science to
BCS[H] Computer Science Applied Computing so I wouldn't have to take
Integral Calculus.

03-60-140 - Probably my favourite course so far.

BYE  (° ͜ʖ ͡)–✧
